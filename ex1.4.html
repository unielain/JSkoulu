<h1>ex 1.4</h1>
<p class="exinfo">In the Percy Jackson children's books, the  Greek gods assign a new camper at Camp half blood to one of the twelve  cabins, which
    are named after the twelve most relevant Greek gods. Write a program that asks for a
    camper's name and draws a cabin for them. If you enter Anna as the name, for example, the program prints to the HTML
    document "Anna, you are  in cabin Aphrodite" (3p)
