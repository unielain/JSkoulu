<h1>ex 1.10</h1>
<p class="exinfo">Make a program that asks the user for the number of dice and the sum of the eye numbers of interest to
    the user. The purpose of your program is now to find out with what probability the number of dice given by the user
    produces the sum of the number of eyes given by the user. For example, if the user enters 3 as the number of dice
    and 17 as the sum of the eyes, the program calculates the probability that the sum of the three dice's eye numbers
    is 17. (5p)</p>
